### Tests
The tests need the directories `testInput` & `testOutput` to run.  
- `testInput` contains all the files that are compared to the test results and therefore need to be established before
  running the tests. only files containing "HappyDay" can be  removed as these are created automatically by the tests.
- `testoutput` can be completely empty and all files in this directory are safe to be deleted
